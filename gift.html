        <p id="gift-text">Before you see it, I'd like to explain why I struggled to create it even though it looks simple to draw. <br>
            This is the first piece of vector art I've ever attempted, and to my surprise, it turned out to be more challenging than expected. <br>
            It took me forever, and  I would have freehanded something better. Anyway , I hope you like it.
